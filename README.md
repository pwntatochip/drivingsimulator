Drivingsimulator or TrafficSim is a project started by the chair of Civil Engineering at CSUS, Dr. Ghazan Khan. It is a VR driving simulator developed in Unreal Engine 5.1.1 for the purposes of studying driver behavior in different traffic scenarios. The simulation is designed to be operated with the Oculus Quest 2 headset and the Logitech G920 driving peripherals, but it can also be completely controlled through mouse and keyboard.  
This application has been developed by TryToTry, a CSUS Computer Science senior project team. This project has been in active development by multiple senior project teams prior to TryToTry and may be developed by other teams in the future.
